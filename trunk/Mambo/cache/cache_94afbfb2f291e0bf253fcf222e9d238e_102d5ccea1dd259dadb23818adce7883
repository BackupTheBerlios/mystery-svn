			If you've read anything at all about Content Management Systems (CMS), you'll probably know at least three things: CMS are the most exciting way to do business, CMS can be really, I mean <i>really</i>, complicated and lastly Portals are absolutely, outrageously, often <i>unaffordably</i> expensive. <br /><br /><img src="http://mystery.berlios.de/Mambo/images/stories/asterisk.png"width="70" height="67" align="left"   hspace="6" alt="Another logo" title="Another logo" border="0" />Mambo is set to change all that ... Mambo is different from the normal models for portal software. For a start, it's not complicated. Mambo has been developed for the masses. It's licensed under the GNU/GPL license, easy to install and administer and reliable. Mambo doesn't even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it's up and running.			</td>
